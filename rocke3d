RUN yum install -y m4
## seems to be missing F90 so some weird line gets substituted into the compile flags
## actually that will happen if the ../config/rules.mk file has the F90 variable unset, perhaps from failing config
## this relates to the line in their "additionally important .modelErc tweaks" which I ignored
# theres a section that you need to uncomment or the code won't compile and this populates the F90 varaible
## might need to pull a gist of the correctly formatted .modelErc file
## all of this just makes sure the modelErc goes to the right spot
